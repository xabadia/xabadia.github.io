This will be a website about language (natural, constructed, pictorial, programming (especially Python)).

Well, I still don't know how does it work, whether can I practice coding HTML in this page. Over 10 years ago I learnt how to code with HTML and I created a few websites in Google Sites, about languages, conlangs (Interlingua, Interglossa, Loglan, ...), pictorial languages (Widgit), etc; I enjoyed writing them directly in HTML. But the Classic Google Sites now are over, and the new Google Sites look far more difficult to handle.
I learnt to code with Python at the Catalan Open University, and I've made a lot of translators and quizzes. I found a way to put it online at Trinket.
Then a few weeks ago I found the free "computer programming" course of the Khan Academy, which has led me here.
