This will be a website about language (natural, constructed, pictorial, programming, especially Python) and Neuro-Linguistic Processing (the psychology theory by Bandler & Grinder, 1975).

Over 10 years ago I learnt how to code with HTML and I created a few websites in Google Sites. But Google has replaced its Classic Google Sites by the new Google Sites, which look far more difficult to handle.

I learnt to code with Python while studying psychology at the Catalan Open University, and I've made a lot of translators and quizzes which may optimize memorization (I wait for your feedback). I found a way to put it online at Trinket. For instance, https://xabadiar.trinket.io/sites/the-alpha-emoji-quiz-draft.

Then a few weeks ago I found the free "computer programming" course of the Khan Academy, which has led me to Github.
