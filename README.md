Over 10 years ago I learnt how to code with HTML and I created a few websites in Google Sites. 

I learnt to code with Python while studying psychology at the Catalan Open University, and I've made a lot of translators and quizzes which may optimize memorization. I found a way to put it online at Trinket.

Then a few weeks ago I found the free computer programming course of the Khan Academy, which has led me to Github.
